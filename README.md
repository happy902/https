# https
**HTTP** **S**tream CLI

## Purpose

The purpose of `https` command is to
* Use HTTP/HTTPS streamingly
* Use HTTPS by default unlike `curl`

The last `s` of `https` has both meanings of **s**tream and HTTP**S** for usability of the flow and higher security.

The design policy is using the same option names with `curl`'s to relieve users' burden not to remember new things and not have confusion as much as possible.
